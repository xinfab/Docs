# Processing Workshop
These files are Processing programs with complete designs. Students can change values, but even if they don't, the program will still run. 
####rotated_rectangle.pde
Students can change the following values:
* stroke & fill (not so much color as whether the drawing has them or not. Colors won't affect lasercutting, but students can still fiddle with them)
* background color
* size of canvas
* number of shapes rotated
* angle of rotation
* the shape (can be an ellipse, a triangle, etc.)
* point of rotation
* color of shape

####repeated_triangles.pde
Students can change the following values:
* stroke weight
* stroke & fill (see above)
* WIDTH
* HEIGHT
* INCREMENT
* beginning coordinates of the shape
* the shape (ex: could adapt the code for an ellipse)

####gaussian_lines.pde (borrows heavily from the example in Processing's reference page on randomGaussian())
Students can change the following values:
* the increment between gaps
* stroke
* stroke weight
* the number of lines drawn (gaussian coefficient)

####random_circles.pde
Students can change the following values:
* stroke
* stroke weight (can even add a line to make the stroke weight random)
* width and height random range
* the number of shapes drawn
* the shape (could do rectangles, triangles)
*
