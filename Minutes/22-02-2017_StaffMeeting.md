## 2. UTSEUS collaboration feedback (+April 15-21 event)
UTSEUS held 2017 spring semester kickoff session at Xinfab on Wed 22 Feb from 16h-18h. Kickoff session was a test to see if space configuration suits their needs. Ongoing discussion on full semester collaboration.
- They proposed to use Xinfab space free of charge from 16h-18h once a week (Wednesday) and offer publicity on their channels (website www.utseus.com and Wechat private groups --- No official account, no other social network). 
- Number of students: 19
- <b>According to UTSEUS, benefits for Xinfab:</b> networking opportunities with speakers of their program, potential members (their students)
- <b>Benefits for us:</b> have a event once a week (filler). Problem: fills up entire space, need to close space, cannot be open to the public (but open for members -- where to put them?)
- <b>Question marks:</b> charge UTSEUS rent? If so, what amount?

## 7. Other outstanding issues: Xinfab calendar planning, space organization (wall, tool wall, machines set up)

####Wall + Tool wall + space organization
- Got greenlight from DT to use the wall
- Need manpower to help design and set up wall and tool wall
- Aurelien's idea: funcional mobile furniture to store tools. 
- Tony: organize tools by craft. Transform current shelf/desk into functional display

####Machines set up
- New staff (Jade,Pamela, Tony, Aurelien) need training to learn how to use laser and 3D printers, so that they can also teach intro workshops.

####Workshop/Event calendar planning
- Need to plan workshops in advance to be able to get more sign ups and also advertise them in wider channels (TimeOut, Smart Shanghai, That's Shanghai, etc)
- <b>Lucio</b>: we need to think of long term workshops that allow people to go beyond beginner level.
- <b>Danny</b> agreed to teach new staff the basics. We will turn those into intro workshops and open them to the public.

### _Action points:

*Jade*:
