### Action Items


####CLEANING AND REDESIGNING XINFAB

###Tools in Lucio's Office
- since Lucio's trip to Shanghai will be delayed, Yuruky can start moving donated tools from the office, using his own judgment
- if there are too many tools in the machine room, we should return the old ones to XCJ
- no one likes a cluttered tool room!
 
####Paying for Materials on Taobao
- staff voted to set RMB 200 as an amount that Yuruky is free to spend at his discretion
  - this will be used towards things like water, wood, etc.
  - this is not cumulative, if Yuruky does not spend 200 RMB one week, it doesn't roll over
  - for technical materials, it's better to ask Lucio or other Xinfab staff before buying, even if it's 200 RMB or less
