#####Remote workshop For Students in Inner Mongolia
- age: 10 - 15
- they want it to "high-tech" workshop
  - Arduino
  - need to design the course
  - need to come up with a price
  - need to set a date
- Yuruky wants to do this, will need to start brainstorming ideas for a workshop
- if this works out and Yuruky is okay with remote teaching, we can spread this to other remote areas in China

#####Corporate team building workshops

  - unknown number of ppl for this workshop, guy will reach out to Yuruky later
- corporate teambuilding could be a great moneymaking opportunity

  - Lukasz to start researching what other corporate training programs inclulde
  - Lukasz can reach out to companies that offer internships at his school

##### Machine Room Tools Workshops
- from Chris (XCJ)
- 3 - 4 hours
- Chris wants us to teach users how to use machine room tools
  - currently lots of XCJ and Xinfab members don't understand how to use them & break them
- Danny needs to talk to Chris to get a better idea of what the workshop's goal is 
  - maybe it's just about safety and can be shorter and simpler
  - do workshop participants HAVE to walk away with something? Might be difficult to teach a comprehensive machine room workshop AND focus on producing a complete object 


###Yuruky Initiatives

#####Office Hours
