*Unassigned:*


Customer Handling:
Want to minimize bureacracy but need some rules.
Payment should not be cash-in-pocket

All staff (paid and unpaid) should be a maker. 

## The Cost of Running XinFab
* 7K for rent
* 3K for staff
* 400 for ayi
* 600 for electricity
* ....plus other cost like buying materials 

-> 11K minimum expenses a month. 

## Making Money
**How we currently make money:**
* memberships
* usage of machines
* service (mainly 3D printing)

**How we *could* start making money:**
* offer XinFab as a space for freelancing makers
  * XinFab would also help market their services (ex:workshoops)
    * XinFab takes a commission on their profit

*Q:* When Lucio does a service, is it for the company or XinFab?
It's for the company. Lucio puts a percentage of this service fee into Xinfab because he directly benefits from being a member and using the space/material/machines to do his service. 

Lucio: "I'm not using XinFab to fund my own interests."

Lucio is willing to pay for the space until the end of 2015. 

Xinfab should not be a manufacturing company that builds products for other people. It's not a prototype house. We don't want Xinfab to move away from makers. - Lucio

Mark: "We need to invest money in marketing people and finance people. We shouldn't be worried about our non-profit reputation.

Needs:
can someone reach out to Xinchejian, ask them about sponsorships?
Grants?
website
Staff workshops?
Need people to create content for Xinfab (pictures, workshops, written stuff)
Need people to manage members (follow up, keep track of their membership, their machines)
need someone to build price list
need to put meeting minutes on wiki
Lucio needs to discuss payment with Lemon (become paid staff)
need open night for Xinfab

Question:
confusing line between Xinchejian and Xinfab?

Keeping track of finance:
Linnah & Sean
set up a system
Sean presents information to Linnah. Linnah helps in organizing part of it (generate reports).
Sean is staff which means he will be in charge of receiving payments during open hours.

Need a system better than our paper system (memberships, machine hours)
Mark put it all on Excel. 

Lucio – the last thing I want is for this place to be like a school

Brenda – (1) workshops (2) service (3) sell products of 3D printing

Mark – print out CNC instructions in English (within 2 weeks). Lemon & Sean can translate.
→ need to contact Spencer from Xinchejian. He's creating a wiki. He's already writing instructions for the CNC. 

Point person for website: Brenda
ask Xinchejian people
contractors
friends

Danny is in charge of temporary website. Will work with Lucio. 

If someone reserves a machine online and doesn't show up, they have to pay for the time anyway. 

Eva to send website requirements to Danny. 

July 6h – Lucio is leaving for a month.
