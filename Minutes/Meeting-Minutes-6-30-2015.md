## *ACTION ITEMS FROM MEETING*


x
*Eva & Simona:*
* send wechat post about Saturday's 3D printing workshop

*Lucio & Mark:*
* Install licensed media onto public computer
* Delete unwanted software

*Miranda & Lucio:*
* call Miranda's friend 6/30 or 7/1 to assess whether or not he can make our website

*Sean:*

## Updates
* Kwali (sp?) events in Lucio's office from time to time 
  * would pay part of the rent
  * would be used in the morning
* App-Ark and Rock want to bring high school students here
  * special corporate membership
  * would use the space for Superlab

## XinFab Finance
* Lucio will give us a six month trial period to see if we can be sustainable
* Lucio needs to create an Alipay account for Xinfab 
  * Money will be sent and retrieved from there 
  * Can document expenses!

## Upcoming Workshops
* CNC
  * CAD - designing
  * CAM – translating design into gcode [2-3 hours]
  * creating CAM file
  * safety
  * how to operate
* Thursday @7pm, 2 – 3 hours
* Saturday: 3D printing workshop

## Future Workshops
* Make a 3D printer 
  * need to create 3D printer kits first 
  * Kits are 4,500 RMB
  * 10 people per workshop

Lucio wants Xinfab staff to feel ownership over the space. Once the farm-fablab in Portugal is built, Lucio would like to build a relationship between the farm-fablab and Xinfab.

## Unpaid Internships (an idea)
**What**: ...where people pay to be our interns!
**Why**: Because they want the China fablab experience. Maybe they want to learn about Taobao, maybe they want to know more about Chinese culture. We would give them the China-fablab experience in exchange for their help in the fablab, plus a fee.

## XinFab Website
* Miranda: friend is willing to do it for a small fee
  * need to skype him, see what he's built before, make it clear what our requirements are
* Xinchejian offered to help host the wiki stuff
  * free options as well – Wikia?
* **Decision**: Danny will create temporary content website. NO to wiki!

## Sharing content
* Use github, not baidu.
* Need to get github information from Xinfab
  * Everyone needs to create a github account and send account info to Lucio
  * then Lucio can add everyone to the Xinfab project. 

## Other
* giant CNC can become a giant 3D printer if we change the nozzle!
* the Chinese government loves fablabs. They might sponsor us. 
  * Jing An contacts, government funding? Need someone who speaks Chinese.
  * Sean to research on Jing An government namecards so we can set up a meeting with them ASAP
* Lucio wants Xinfab staff to feel ownership over the space
  * Once the farm-fablab in Portugal is built, Lucio would like to build a relationship between the farm-fablab and Xinfab.
