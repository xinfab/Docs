### Event/Workshop Opportunities

#####Remote workshop For Students in Inner Mongolia
- age: 10 - 15
- they want it to "high-tech" workshop
  - Arduino
  - need to design the course
  - need to come up with a price
  - need to set a date
- Yuruky wants to do this, will need to start brainstorming ideas for a workshop
- if this works out and Yuruky is okay with remote teaching, we can spread this to other remote areas in China

#####Corporate team building workshops
- a guy from Philip Design approached Yuruky about possibly running corporate team building events at Xinfab
  - unknown number of ppl for this workshop, guy will reach out to Yuruky later
- corporate teambuilding could be a great moneymaking opportunity
- Danny: should follow up with other companies
  - Lucasz to start researching what other corporate training programs inclulde
  - Lucasz can reach out to companies that offer internships at his school

##### Machine Room Tools Workshops
- from Chris (XCJ)
- 3 - 4 hours
- Chris wants us to teach users how to use machine room tools
  - currently lots of XCJ and Xinfab members don't understand how to use them & break them
- Danny needs to talk to Chris to get a better idea of what the workshop's goal is 
  - maybe it's just about safety and can be shorter and simpler
  - do workshop participants HAVE to walk away with something? Might be difficult to teach a comprehensive machine room workshop AND focus on producing a complete object 

##### Beyond the Bund
- waiting on Sarah Ali
  - see if she can offer us work tables/chairs or website help

###Yuruky Initiatives

#####Instant Making
- need to figure out what kind of materials are suitable or easy for participants to use

#####Office Hours
- Yuruky needs to know what resources we have
  - resources as in: skills, technical support, materials, machines
- also need to know resources we can refer people to 
  - how much is a high quality 3D scanner?
  
#####XinFab Maker Roundtable
- Yuruky to contact Chris, ask about XCJ's Roundtable
